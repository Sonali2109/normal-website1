        <p><em>Student at <a href="https://www.mgmpoly.com/">MGM's Polytechnic</a> and <strong>a learner</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I was born in Maharashtra and grew up in Aurangabad. I did my schooling at English Medium High School and am now pursuing my Diploma from MGM's Polytechnic . My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. This is because I believe success and failures are the best way to build ourselves to reach our goals. And I believe in myself and my hard work, and I want fulfillment in everything. My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering, take up a challenge in some good organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a renowned software developer in an organization and reach the highest level of success.</p></td>
